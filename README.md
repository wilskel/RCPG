# rngcp
Random chord progression generator using Baroque-esque theory rules.

Enter a key into the text field and a random chord progression will be generated.
Using sharp (#) notation, (C, C#, D, D#, etc.) (Enharmonic notes such as E# and B# will not work)
There's a 50/50 chance of the progression ending with a Authentic cadence or a Deceptive candence, that's it!
